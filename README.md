- 👋 Hi, I’m @ChrixxxL , an undergraduate student who is keen on combining music and technology.  
- 👀 I’m interested in music technology and production, HCI and audio programming :)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, HTML, CSS and Java, academically approaching PyCharm for specific audio programming.
- 🎙️ I'm using Logic Pro X, Ableton, Pro Tools and Reaper as my main DAWs for production and research, primarily Logic.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any sound / music-related projects and realize it through coding and technical setup.
- 📫 Contact me by leaving notes in GitHub :)
